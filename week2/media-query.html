            <h2>James 3 : 6-8</h2>
            <p>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body,
            and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
            
            For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
            mankind:
            
            But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>

            <h2>2 Nephi 2 : 5</h2>
            <p>And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no
            flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the
            spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.</p>
